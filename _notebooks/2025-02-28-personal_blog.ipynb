    "# Pawnsy - AP CSP Connection & CPT Alignment\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Pawnsy is a full-stack project that implements CRUD operations, and in my case to manage a ranking system. The Flask backend serves as a REST API, while our frontend dynamically updates the leaderboard. This project effectively demonstrates networking, data management, algorithms, and computing impact, aligning with AP CSP‚Äôs Big Ideas and College Board‚Äôs CPT guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection to AP CSP Big Ideas\n",
    "### Big Idea 1: Creative Development\n",
    "The development of Pawnsy involved designing a structured frontend-backend system.\n",
    "Users can interact with the leaderboard dynamically, displaying real-time updates.\n",
    "Implementing DOM manipulation and event listeners showcases problem-solving.\n",
    "Fetch API integration allows seamless client-server communication.\n",
    "Example: Frontend Fetching Leaderboard Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "async function fetchGames() {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const response = await fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/pastgames`, fetchOptions);\n",
    "        const games = await response.json();\n",
    "        document.getElementById(\"leaderboard-body\").innerHTML = \"\";\n",
    "        games.forEach((game, index) => {\n",
    "            const score = game.number_of_wins + game.number_of_losses;\n",
    "            const row = `<tr>\n",
    "                <td>${index + 1}</td>\n",
    "                <td>${game.user_name}</td>\n",
    "                <td>${score}</td>\n",
    "            </tr>`;\n",
    "            leaderboardBody.innerHTML += row;\n",
    "        });\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "        console.error('Error fetching leaderboard:', error);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Demonstrates structured development and problem-solving.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Big Idea 2: Data**\n",
    "The Flask SQLAlchemy model efficiently stores player statistics.\n",
    "CRUD operations allow for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of leaderboard data.\n",
    "JSON responses facilitate data exchange between the backend and frontend.\n",
    "Example: Retrieving Leaderboard Data from the Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route(\"/api/user_stats/<string:name>\", methods=[\"GET\"])\n",
    "def get_user_stats(name):\n",
    "    user = User.query.filter_by(_name=name).first()\n",
    "    if not user:\n",
    "        return jsonify({'error': 'User not found'}), 404\n",
    "    user_stats = UserStats.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).first()\n",
    "    return jsonify(user_stats.read()), 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úîÔ∏è Demonstrates data persistence, JSON-based API responses, and efficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming**\n",
    "The backend API follows structured CRUD operations to manage user scores.\n",
    "The frontend algorithm dynamically sorts players based on total games played.\n",
    "Selection, iteration, and sequencing are utilized in fetchGames().\n",
    "Example: Sorting the Leaderboard (Iteration & Selection)\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "games.sort((a, b) => (b.number_of_wins + b.number_of_losses) - (a.number_of_wins + a.number_of_losses));\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Demonstrates iteration (looping through players) and selection (sorting logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks**\n",
    "The frontend makes HTTP requests to the backend using the Fetch API.\n",
    "The backend handles API requests over HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "The project demonstrates client-server interaction over a network.\n",
    "Example: API Call to Update Score\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/user_stats/update_score`, {\n",
    "    method: \"POST\",\n",
    "    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n",
    "    body: JSON.stringify({ name: \"Player1\", result: \"win\" })\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Demonstrates HTTP-based data exchange and secure API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing**\n",
    "The leaderboard improves user engagement by providing a real-time ranking system.\n",
    "Users interact dynamically through a visual leaderboard UI.\n",
    "Efficient database management ensures data reliability and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Demonstrates positive computing impact in a competitive gaming environment.\n",
    "\n",
