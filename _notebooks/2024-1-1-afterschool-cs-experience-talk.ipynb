    "### Organizing Properly\n",
    "- **Decomposition** is key: break big problems into small pieces, then reassemble for solutions\n",
    "- **Project-based learning** makes this process fun and engaging\n",
    "- Using **AGILE** and **Scrum** can make me a lot more credible and organized\n",

    "For example: Using this blog, I can break down improvements I should make, and then see my progress on those improvements every now and then by referring back to the blog.\n",

    "- Use **numbers** to show impact\n",

    "- Criticism can be helpful\n",
    "- Pick and choose the feedback that works best for me, and begin implementing it to show progression.\n",
