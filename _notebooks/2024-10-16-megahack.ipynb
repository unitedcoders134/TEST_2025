    "## **Hack Description: Task Manager**\n",
    "This hack is a simple task management program that allows users to perform basic operations like adding tasks, categorizing tasks by priority, marking tasks as complete, and deleting them. The task manager uses several key programming concepts such as variables, data abstraction, boolean expressions, conditionals, and iterations. Each feature corresponds to one of the programming topics outlined in the image, making it an educational exercise in combining different units.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 1 — Variables and Assignments**\n",
    "Variables store information that the program uses to track tasks and task-related properties. In this hack:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "tasks = []: This variable holds a list of tasks. Each task is represented as a dictionary that stores information about the task (description, priority, completion status, etc.).\n",
    "task_id = 1: This variable tracks the task numbers, ensuring that each task has a unique identifier.\n",
    "Variables are assigned values as new tasks are added or modified, allowing the program to dynamically store and access the task data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 2 — Data Abstraction**\n",
    "Data abstraction involves structuring data in a way that allows for easier handling and manipulation. In this hack, each task is represented as a dictionary, an abstract data type that stores key-value pairs. Here's an example of a task:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"id\": 1,\n",
    "    \"description\": \"Finish homework\",\n",
    "    \"priority\": 1,  # 1 for high, 2 for medium, 3 for low\n",
    "    \"completed\": False\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The use of dictionaries allows us to bundle different attributes of a task (ID, description, priority, and completion status) into a single entity. This makes the data easy to manipulate and expand if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 3 — Mathematical Expressions**\n",
    "The priority system in the hack uses simple mathematical expressions to assign numeric values to different task priorities:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1 for High\n",
    "2 for Medium\n",
    "3 for Low\n",
    "These numeric values allow us to later compare and sort tasks based on their urgency. The user inputs an integer that represents the priority level when creating a task:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def set_priority():\n",
    "    print(\"Set task priority: 1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low\")\n",
    "    return int(input(\"Choose priority (1, 2, 3): \"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The input is converted to an integer so that it can be used in future calculations or comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 4 — Strings and String Operations**\n",
    "Users provide task descriptions as strings, and the program handles these strings to create and manage tasks. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "description = input(\"Enter task description: \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This allows users to input custom task descriptions like \"Finish homework\" or \"Go grocery shopping.\" The task description is stored in the task dictionary, and when the task is displayed, it is formatted and printed as a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"ID: {task['id']}, Description: {task['description']}, Priority: {task['priority']}, Status: {status}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, string formatting (using f-strings) is used to dynamically display task information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 5 — Boolean Expressions**\n",
    "Boolean values are used to track whether tasks are completed or not. The completed attribute of each task is a boolean variable that can be either True or False. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"completed\": False\n",
    "```\n",
    "Boolean expressions allow us to check and change the status of a task:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def mark_task_done(task_id):\n",
    "    for task in tasks:\n",
    "        if task[\"id\"] == task_id:\n",
    "            task[\"completed\"] = True  # Mark the task as completed\n",
    "            print(f\"Task {task_id} marked as done!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we use boolean logic to update the completion status when the user marks a task as done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 6 — Conditionals**\n",
    "Conditionals control the flow of the program based on user input or the state of the tasks. For example, when modifying a task, the user is asked whether they want to mark it as done or delete it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "choice = input(\"Enter 'done' to mark as completed or 'delete' to remove task: \").lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if choice == 'done':\n",
    "    mark_task_done(task_id)\n",
    "elif choice == 'delete':\n",
    "    delete_task(task_id)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid option!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, conditionals (if, elif, else) handle the different user actions based on their choice. The program performs different operations depending on the condition that is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 7 — Nested Conditionals**\n",
    "Nested conditionals are conditionals within conditionals. This is useful when you need to make multiple checks to ensure a correct operation. For instance, when deleting a task, we first check if the task exists and whether it is completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def delete_task(task_id):\n",
    "    for task in tasks:\n",
    "        if task[\"id\"] == task_id:\n",
    "            if task[\"completed\"]:  # Nested conditional\n",
    "                tasks.remove(task)\n",
    "                print(f\"Task {task_id} deleted!\")\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                print(\"Task not completed yet. Complete it before deleting.\")\n",
    "            return\n",
    "    print(\"Task not found!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the task is not completed, the program does not allow deletion, adding an extra layer of checks using nested conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 8 — Iterations**\n",
    "Iterations are used to loop through the list of tasks and perform actions on each task. For example, when the user views all tasks, the program loops over each task in the tasks list:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def view_tasks():\n",
    "    if not tasks:\n",
    "        print(\"No tasks to show.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        for task in tasks:\n",
    "            status = \"Done\" if task[\"completed\"] else \"Pending\"\n",
    "            print(f\"ID: {task['id']}, Description: {task['description']}, Priority: {task['priority']}, Status: {status}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The for loop iterates through each task in the list, checking its status and printing it to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unit 10 — Lists**\n",
    "The list data structure is used to store all the tasks. Each time a task is added, it is appended to the tasks list:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tasks.append(task)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists allow us to dynamically store tasks and perform operations such as iterating, appending, and removing tasks. We use a list to efficiently store and manage a collection of tasks in one place.\n",
