    "- **Made a database** that stores **users** as well as their **win/loss ratio**.\n",
    "- **Created frontend changes** to enable adding and removing users through an **admin panel**.\n",
    "- **Created a lookup page** using **Read requests** to dynamically display the **id, wins, and losses** of users.\n",

    "**Chess social platform** to discuss, analyze, and learn **chess content**.  \n",
    "Our project is a **social media website and forum** where users can **discuss chess topics** and interact with **Artificial Intelligence** to learn and play chess.\n",

    "## **Individual Feature**\n",
    "The purpose of my feature is to **store users' win/loss data** and eventually turn it into a **leaderboard system**.  \n",
    "This enables a **competitive aspect** to our website even when itâ€™s only with **AI**.  \n",
    "It also allows for a **moderator system** where moderators can **edit the data** of users who abuse the **reporting wins/losses system**.\n",

    "  - **GET request**: Fetching **user stats** (e.g., wins and losses) when viewing or managing users, as seen in the **admin panel**.\n",
    "  - **POST request**: Creating a **new user** in the database, allowing the addition of **user IDs** along with optional wins and losses.\n",
    "  - **PATCH request**: Updating **specific fields** in the database (e.g., wins or losses after a game).  \n",
    "    **PATCH** is used instead of **PUT** to avoid replacing all fields, which is **unnecessary and inefficient**.\n",
    "  - **DELETE request**: Removing a **user** from the database, executed via the **admin panel interface**.\n",
