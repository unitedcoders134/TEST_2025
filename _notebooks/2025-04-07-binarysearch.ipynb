    "The procedure BinarySearch(numList, target) correctly implements a binary search algorithm on the list of numbers numList. The procedure returns an index here target occurs in numList, or -1 if target does not occur in numList.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following conditions must be met in order for the procedure to work as intended? Explain why.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) The length of numList must be even\n",
    "b) The list numList must not contain any duplicate values\n",
    "c) The values in numList must be in sorted order\n",
    "d) The value of target must not be equal to -1\n",

    "Which of the following statements correctly describes a disadvantage of binary search compared to linear search? Explain why your answer is correct and why the others are wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Binary search takes more time on average than linear search  \n",
    "b) Binary search cannot be used on unsorted lists without modifications  \n",

    "d) Binary search can only be used on lists with unique values  \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary searches cannot be used on unsorted lists without modifications. This is because binary search relies on the fact that the list is sorted. \n",
