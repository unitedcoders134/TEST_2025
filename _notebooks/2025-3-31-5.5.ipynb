    "Some ways you can protect intellectual property is through a patent. For example, patents can protect intellectual property by ensuring that others cannot copy or recreate a design or idea that you already have, without your permission. Copyrights also protect anything classifying as a work of art, or something else of that sort. Trademarks protect brand names, logos, and other symbols that identify a business or product. Trade secrets protect secrets and methods that people use to make products or services. Patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets are all ways to protect. Using DRM tools also can help prevent people from stealing online property aswell. \n",
