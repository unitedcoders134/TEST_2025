    "üî¢ List Creation Basics ‚Äì Python lists can be created using the list() constructor or, more commonly, with square brackets. They can be initialized with or without values.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ûï Appending Values ‚Äì You can add items using the .append() method, which always adds to the end, maintaining the order of insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìç Indexing and Access ‚Äì Elements are accessed using zero-based indexing. Negative indices access elements from the end (-1 is the last item).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÇÔ∏è Slicing Technique ‚Äì Lists can be sliced using [start:stop]. The start is inclusive and the stop is exclusive, enabling retrieval of sublists.\n",
    "\n",
    "üåÄ Mixed Data Types ‚Äì Unlike many other languages, Python lists can store multiple types: integers, strings, booleans, floats, and even other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ôªÔ∏è Duplicates Allowed ‚Äì Lists allow duplicate values, which distinguishes them from sets where duplicates are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîó Concatenation & Utilities ‚Äì Lists can be combined using the + operator. Methods like dir() and help() can explore more list functionalities."

    "\n",
    "üîç Simple to Advanced Transformations ‚Äì Basic transformations like copying a list or squaring numbers are simplified using syntax like [n*n for n in nums].\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì Conditional Comprehensions ‚Äì You can filter elements with conditions inside comprehensions, e.g., [n for n in nums if n % 2 == 0] to get even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîÑ Replacing Map/Filter Functions ‚Äì List comprehensions replace less readable constructs like map() and filter() combined with lambda, providing clarity to newer developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß± Nested Comprehensions ‚Äì Comprehensions can handle nested loops, such as generating coordinate-like tuples with [ (letter, num) for letter in 'ABCD' for num in range(4) ].\n",
    "\n",
    "üìö Beyond Lists: Dictionaries and Sets ‚Äì Python also supports dictionary and set comprehensions using {} syntax, like {name: hero for name, hero in zip(names, heroes)} or {n for n in nums} for unique items.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚öôÔ∏è Generator Expressions ‚Äì Similar in syntax to list comprehensions but using (), these lazily evaluate values, providing memory efficiency when iterating large datasets.\n",
