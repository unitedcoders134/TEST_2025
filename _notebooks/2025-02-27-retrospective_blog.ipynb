    "**Introduction** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final retrospective is a deep reflection on the work I've done over the past trimester. It’s an opportunity to assess my areas of improvement and weaknesses as well the most notable things I've learned and goals for future computer science projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal Strenghts and Achivements** \n",
    "Here are 5 of my greatest achievements throughout the trimester. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1️⃣** **Created a dynamicaly changing leaderboard system** \n",
    "\n",
    "Created API to automatically store games integrated with preset login system, and frontend design to fetch from database and display on webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/leaderboardsystem.png\" width=\"750px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2️⃣**  **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Worked Alongside Mr.Buxton to host and share our own N@TM to share ideas and recieve different perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fostered meaningful conversations by presenting ideas and reviewing other student's works \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/n@tm 1.png\" width=\"750px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/n@tm 2.png\" width=\"750px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provided constructive feeback to many groups \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3️⃣** **Worked Collaboratively with team-mates to prevent reduncancy**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Old features had no relevance to the user \n",
    " - Scattered All Over \n",
    " - As assistant scrum I integrated these features together, allowed them to all serve a distinct but important feature to the user.\n",
    " <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot%202025-03-07%20083801.png\" width=\"750px\">\n",
    " - Communicated through Slack with other teammaates like Jowan to distrubute workload evenly. \n",
    "      - After our initial deployment review, lots of changes were made in our work dynamic. Many users ended up switching into different features and so on. Collaboration was especially important to make sure all of us had the same goal and were working together to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4️⃣** **Created Working Administrative Panel**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looked at Pawnsy from perspective from Administrator As Well as User - Created an Administrative Panel for our team to reflect and evaaulation \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/admin panel.png\" width=\"750px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetches wins and losses in a dropdown system and allows administratives to edit the wins and losses of users - therefore effecting the leaderboard system. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5️⃣** **Implemented JWT Authentication**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented JWT authentication on Pawnsy to create an experienced personally tailored. Users having different web pages than admins, admins having different permissions than users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logged in vs Logged Out Homepage\n",

    "## Project Feature Writeup (CPT & FRQ Language)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mihir Thaha - Project Feature Writeup (CPT & FRQ Language)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pawnsy is a full-stack project that implements a real-time ranking system with full CRUD functionality. The project follows a structured frontend-backend integration, where the Flask backend provides API endpoints for data storage, retrieval, and updates, while the JavaScript-based frontend dynamically renders the leaderboard using DOM manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project demonstrates key computing principles, including data abstraction, algorithms, networking, and computing impact. Users can interact with the leaderboard by viewing rankings, updating scores, and managing data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backend Implementation & API Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend, built using Flask and Flask-RESTful, supports a leaderboard system where player rankings and scores are stored in a SQLAlchemy database model. It exposes API endpoints that allow the frontend to fetch and update leaderboard data dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Student-Developed Procedure: Handling Score Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a procedure that processes user score updates based on game outcomes. The function listens for a POST request at /user_stats/update_score and modifies the database accordingly.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/user_stats/update_score', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def update_score():\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()\n",
    "    name = data.get('name')\n",
    "    result = data.get('result')\n",
    "\n",
    "    if not name or result not in ['win', 'loss']:\n",
    "        return jsonify({'error': 'Valid Name and result (win/loss) are required'}), 400\n",
    "\n",
    "    user = User.query.filter_by(_name=name).first()\n",
    "    if not user:\n",
    "        return jsonify({'error': 'User not found'}), 404\n",
    "\n",
    "    user_stats = UserStats.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).first()\n",
    "    if not user_stats:\n",
    "        return jsonify({'error': 'User stats not found'}), 404\n",
    "\n",
    "    if result == 'win':\n",
    "        user_stats.wins += 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        user_stats.losses += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    user_stats.update()\n",
    "    return jsonify({'message': 'User stats updated successfully', 'data': user_stats.read()}), 200\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Procedural Abstraction: This function abstracts the logic required to process score updates and integrates with the SQLAlchemy model to modify data in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frontend Implementation & API Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend is responsible for dynamically fetching, displaying, and updating leaderboard rankings using JavaScript, the Fetch API, and DOM manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ Overall sequence: \n",
    "First, pythonURI is defined in the script tag, then a fetch request is made to the backend to retrieve leaderboard data. This data is stored in a JavaScript variable and accessed through the DOM, using a forEach loop to populate the leaderboard dynamically. Buttons on each entry are assigned event listeners to handle CRUD operations dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm for Fetching Leaderboard Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "async function fetchLeaderboard() {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const response = await fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/user_stats`);\n",
    "        const users = await response.json();\n",
    "        const leaderboardBody = document.getElementById(\"leaderboard-body\");\n",
    "        leaderboardBody.innerHTML = \"\";\n",
    "\n",
    "        users.forEach((user, index) => {\n",
    "            const row = `<tr>\n",
    "                <td>${index + 1}</td>\n",
    "                <td>${user.user_name}</td>\n",
    "                <td>${user.wins + user.losses}</td>\n",
    "            </tr>`;\n",
    "            leaderboardBody.innerHTML += row;\n",
    "        });\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "        console.error('Error fetching leaderboard:', error);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### ✔ Use of a List: The function retrieves a list of all users from the API response, demonstrating data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "async function fetchLeaderboard() {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const response = await fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/user_stats`);\n",
    "        const users = await response.json();  // users is a list of player objects\n",
    "        const leaderboardBody = document.getElementById(\"leaderboard-body\");\n",
    "        leaderboardBody.innerHTML = \"\";\n",
    "\n",
    "        users.forEach((user, index) => {\n",
    "            const row = `<tr>\n",
    "                <td>${index + 1}</td>\n",
    "                <td>${user.user_name}</td>\n",
    "                <td>${user.wins + user.losses}</td>\n",
    "            </tr>`;\n",
    "            leaderboardBody.innerHTML += row;\n",
    "        });\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "        console.error('Error fetching leaderboard:', error);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Example: User Providing Data for Score Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ User input is collected through text fields and buttons, which trigger fetch requests to send data to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "const playerName = prompt(\"Enter your name:\");\n",
    "const result = prompt(\"Enter 'win' or 'loss':\");\n",
    "\n",
    "fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/user_stats/update_score`, {\n",
    "    method: \"POST\",\n",
    "    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n",
    "    body: JSON.stringify({ name: playerName, result: result })\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ User input is dynamically processed and sent to the backend for updates. ✔ Ensures players can manually update their scores in the leaderboard system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection Example: User Authentication for Data Modification\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Selection ensures security, restricting unauthorized leaderboard modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let user_name = await getUser();\n",
    "if (user_name.toLowerCase() !== name.toLowerCase()) {\n",
    "    console.log('Logged in user cannot remove another user’s card');\n",
    "    return;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ This if-statement ensures that only the owner of the leaderboard entry can modify or delete their own record. ✔ Prevents unauthorized users from tampering with leaderboard rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration Example: Deleting a User from the Leaderboard\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Iteration systematically searches through all user records to find and delete the target entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "def delete(self):\n",
    "    body = request.get_json()\n",
    "    user_stats = UserStats.query.get(body['id'])\n",
    "    if not user_stats:\n",
    "        return {'message': 'User stats not found'}, 404\n",
    "    user_stats.delete()\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"message\": \"User stats deleted\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ This function loops through the database to identify a matching user record. ✔ Ensures only existing leaderboard records can be deleted. ✔ Returns an error message if the requested record is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment & CI/CD Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Automated Deployment using Docker-Compose: The project was deployed using Docker-Compose, allowing for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient environment configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Seamless backend updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable API interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Security & Authentication:\n",
    "\n",
    "JWT authentication verifies users before allowing leaderboard updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection statements (if-else checks) ensure only authorized users can modify rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTPS enforcement with Certbot secures API communication.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Video games and more specifically they're exploits - are what got me into Computer Science in the first place. I want to look more into designing games. \n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Courses: AP CSA; seen N@TM projects from CSA and looks like something to look foward too. \n",

    "**Key Takeaways and Strenghts**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Communication and Collaboration: \n",
    "\n",
    "Gained Ability to collaborate in a team and work on full-stack applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various methods of communication for example Kanban boards on github pages, Slack Channels, I-message groupchats, Liveshares.\n",

    "2. Leading with Data and the importance of visuals: \n",
    "\n",
    "Tried implimenting this strategy in Today's MCQ as well! \n",
    "\n",
    "Using data and more visuals from feedback from previous presntations:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Strong understanding of frontend-backend integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gained a much stronger understanding of frontend-backend integration rather than first trimester.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Learned how to talk in CPT Language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps & Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: From N@TM many users saw something that we ovrlooked: Not being able to play as black. Users are missing out on about half the whole game of chess. We'd also want to be able to develop an ELO system rather than sorting our leaderboard based of matches played, which would them organize things better. Users also seemed very eager about the idea of puzzle like games and tactics (similar to popular chess websites)\n",
    "\n",
    "Takeaways: After collaborating with San Diego group, these are takeaways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Takeaways- \n",
    "\n",
    "Looks like our presentation can be improved a bit more to make it more consistent across groups, as for some groups we mainly focused on the game page as it was the most flashy and interesting intially. We could be more consistent with showing the analysis and other types of features.\n",
    "Seems like UI was also something that came up, some better UI testing and making a cleaner more cohesive webpage would also go along way.\n",
    "Expanding upon the analysis feature could also be a new implementation in the future, and expanding upon the analysis API and displying it with a simpler analysis page UI.\n",
    "Add more explanation for game function on the game and analysis as some users seemed a bit confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taking interest in other groups!\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/code259/sprint4_frontend/issues/43\n",
    "\n",
    "or In our DECA N@TM, One group that particularly caught my eye was 'Take a Byte'. Not only was the name of the project creative and collaborative, their home page displays it proudly at the top - which was pretty attractive to my eye. This group was presented at N@TM from 5:15-5:45, and hosted by Yuva Bala. I was particularly impressed by the \"smoothness\" of the project. It was clear to me the collaboratoin that went on behind the scenes - as our group had struggled with this ourselves. All team members apparently had individual features, but they worked hand-in-hand to create a seamless user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also provided feedback that the UI's were hard to follow - and I feel like as a user I would have been a bit \"lost\" on the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reaching out to someone about preparing for the Final Exam:\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare for this exam, I reached out to someone who I've never talked to before - Michelle Kuruvilla to ask about resources and how she prepared for the exam. She shared with me er blog as well as many tips on presenting it and what worked for her.\n",
