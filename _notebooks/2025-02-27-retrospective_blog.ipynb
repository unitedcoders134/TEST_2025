    "**Introduction** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final retrospective is a deep reflection on the work I've done over the past trimester. It’s an opportunity to assess my areas of improvement and weaknesses as well the most notable things I've learned and goals for future computer science projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal Strenghts and Achivements** \n",
    "Here are 5 of my greatest achievements throughout the trimester. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1️⃣** **Created a dynamicaly changing leaderboard system** \n",
    "\n",
    "Created API to automatically store games integrated with preset login system, and frontend design to fetch from database and display on webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](/images/leaderboardsystem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2️⃣**  **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Worked Alongside Mr.Buxton to host and share our own N@TM to share ideas and recieve different perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fostered meaningful conversations by presenting ideas and reviewing other student's works \n",
    "\n",
    "- ![image-6.png](/images/n@tm1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-7.png](/images/n@tm%202.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provided constructive feeback to many groups \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3️⃣** **Worked Collaboratively with team-mates to prevent reduncancy**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Old features had no relevance to the user \n",
    " - Scattered All Over \n",
    " - As assistant scrum I integrated these features together, allowed them to all serve a distinct but important feature to the user.\n",
    " - ![image-2.png](/images/Screenshot%202025-03-07%20083801.png)\n",
    " - Communicated through Slack with other teammaates like Jowan to distrubute workload evenly. \n",
    "      - After our initial deployment review, lots of changes were made in our work dynamic. Many users ended up switching into different features and so on. Collaboration was especially important to make sure all of us had the same goal and were working together to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4️⃣** **Created Working Administrative Panel**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looked at Pawnsy from perspective from Administrator As Well as User - Created an Administrative Panel for our team to reflect and evaaulation \n",
    "\n",
    "![image-5.png](/images/admin%20panel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetches wins and losses in a dropdown system and allows administratives to edit the wins and losses of users - therefore effecting the leaderboard system. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5️⃣** **Implemented JWT Authentication**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented JWT authentication on Pawnsy to create an experienced personally tailored. Users having different web pages than admins, admins having different permissions than users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logged in vs Logged Out Homepage\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-3.png](/images/logged%20out.png)\n",
    "![image-4.png](/images/logged%20in.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Goals in Computer Science**\n",
    "\n",
    "Video games and more specifically they're exploits - are what got me into Computer Science in the first place. I want to look more into designing games. \n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Courses: AP CSA; seen N@TM projects from CSA and looks like something to look foward too. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways and Strenghts**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Communication and Collaboration: \n",
    "\n",
    "Gained Ability to collaborate in a team and work on full-stack applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various methods of communication for example Kanban boards on github pages, Slack Channels, I-message groupchats, Liveshares.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/age-8.png\" alt=\"image\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Leading with Data and the importance of visuals: \n",
    "\n",
    "Tried implimenting this strategy in Today's MCQ as well! \n",
    "\n",
    "Using data and more visuals from feedback from previous presntations:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Strong understanding of frontend-backend integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gained a much stronger understanding of frontend-backend integration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps & Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: From N@TM many users saw something that we ovrlooked: Not being able to play as black. We'd also want to be able to develop an ELO system rather than sorting our leaderboard based of matches played.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence in implementing user-generated content features and database handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaching out to someone about preparing for the Final Exam:\n",

I used these 12 weeks wisely spending hours outside of school preparing for this class - which Paid off as from feedback from N@TM Pawnsy was a successfull project. |\n",
