This collaborating makes it so much easier to solve problems and helps me see the value in my teammate's imput.

    "Through this project, I've made substantial strides in my JavaScript skills. While I initially had only a basic understanding of the language, I now feel confident working with variables, loops, and functions. I've also become more adept at string manipulation, conditional statements, and arrays. This project provided me with opportunities to apply these concepts practically, significantly boosting my ability to write, debug, and refine JavaScript code. I also gained a lot from collaborating with my teammates and using additional resources. Prior to this, I had a decent grasp of Python but very little exposure to JavaScript. Thanks to this project and class, I've overcome those challenges and developed my JavaScript skills to their fullest potential."
