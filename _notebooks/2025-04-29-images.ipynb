    "âœ… What is Base64 and how is it used with images?\n",
    "Base64 is a method of encoding binary data (like images) into a text string using 64 characters (Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z, 0â€“9, +, /). This allows binary data to be safely embedded in text-based formats such as HTML, CSS, or JSON.\n",

    "âœ… Why might you use Base64 instead of a regular image file?\n",
    "Using Base64 images is helpful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… You want fewer HTTP requests (faster page loads for small images).\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… You're embedding images directly into emails or JSON responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… You're working on a self-contained web page (like for GitHub Pages without needing external assets).\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… You want to avoid broken image links when deploying static sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Base64 increases the file size by ~33%, so itâ€™s better for small icons or logos, not large photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’» Application to My Work:\n",
